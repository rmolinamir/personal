This is an OS-inspired personal site with a desktop shell, windowed apps, and playful system interactions.
The experience is meant to feel like a lightweight desktop: icons on the wallpaper, windowed apps, and system overlays.

## Architecture

### Core Logic

- [`apps/web/src/routes`](./apps/web/src/routes): Tanstack Router is used to orchestrate navigation and routing within the application.
- [`apps/web/src/routes/-components`](./apps/web/src/routes/-components): Includes the website's core components, such as the System, Desktop, Applications, and OS-themed framework integration.

### Component Library

- [`packages/ui/src/os`](./packages/ui/src/os): This is the implementation of the OS-themed components.

### Styling

- [`apps/web/src/styles.css`](./apps/web/src/styles.css): These are the CSS styles of the website.
- [`packages/ui/src/styles.css`](./packages/ui/src/styles.css): And these are the base CSS styles of the pure components.

### Stories

- [`apps/web/src/stories`](./apps/web/src/stories): These are the stories of the website's components. This is a playground to experiment with the components and it's mostly used by agents to test while developing via Playwright, but it's also used to sanity check a11y, etc.
