# Specs Agent Guide

Purpose
- Use this folder for planning, architecture notes, and design intent.
- Keep docs current with implementation changes.

Workflow
- Update specs when behaviors, APIs, or file locations change.
- Prefer short, direct bullets; avoid long prose.
- Add new topics as separate files; keep filenames stable.

Scope
- Specs are guidance, not a source of truth for runtime behavior.
- Link to code files when it helps map intent to implementation.
